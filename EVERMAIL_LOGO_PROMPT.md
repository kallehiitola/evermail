## Brand Context & Usage

### Where the Logo Will Appear
- **Web App**: Browser tab (favicon), navigation header, login page
- **Marketing Website**: Hero section, footer, pricing pages
- **Mobile App** (Phase 2): App icon (iOS/Android), splash screen
- **Business**: Email signatures, invoices (Stripe), support docs
- **Social Media**: Profile pictures, cover images, OG images
- **Print** (if needed): Business cards, presentations

### Logo Hierarchy
1. **Primary**: Full color, icon + wordmark horizontal
2. **Secondary**: Icon only (for app icons, tight spaces)
3. **Tertiary**: Wordmark only (for wide layouts)

### Spacing & Safe Area
- Minimum clear space: Height of the 'e' in "evermail" on all sides
- Minimum size: 24px height (web), 32px height (print)
- Icon-only minimum: 16px × 16px (favicon)

## Competitor Analysis (For Differentiation)

### Existing Email/Archive Services
- **Gmail**: Red/blue/yellow/green multi-color M (playful, consumer)
- **Outlook**: Blue O with envelope (corporate, dated)
- **MailStore**: Orange shield (enterprise, security-focused)
- **Proton Mail**: Purple envelope with atom (privacy, technical)

### Differentiation Strategy
- **Avoid**: Obvious envelope/inbox iconography (too common)
- **Embrace**: Modern geometric abstraction, infinity/continuity concepts
- **Stand out**: Use sophisticated color (purple/teal vs standard blue), AI hints (sparkle, gradient)

## Questions for Designer

Before starting design work, clarify:

1. **Budget**: What's the allocated budget for logo design?
2. **Timeline**: When is the MVP launch? (affects urgency)
3. **Scope**: Full brand identity or just logo for now?
4. **Stakeholders**: Who needs to approve final design?
5. **Existing assets**: Any existing visuals/mockups to reference?
6. **Future plans**: Mobile app confirmed for Phase 2? (affects app icon design)

---

**Test everywhere**: Browser tabs, mobile app icons, email signatures, social media profiles, website header, loading screens.

**Keep it simple**: The best logos are deceptively simple. Think Apple, Nike, Stripe, Linear.

**Good luck!** 🎨🚀
